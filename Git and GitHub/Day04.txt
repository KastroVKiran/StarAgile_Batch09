Git and GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
==> .gitignore

==> Renaming a branch
git branch -m recharge payment

Note: If you change the branch name in local, that change is available only for local. It cannot be changed in remote repo

==> PULL REQUEST

==> BRANCH MERGING

==> git merge Vs git rebase
Merge will show files, rebase wont show

git merge
git log --oneline
a8cba63 (HEAD -> dth, origin/dth) Merge branch 'payment' into dth
aba1401 (origin/recharge, origin/payment, payment) recharges files added
d363830 added dth files
9770e37 created master text file

git rebase

git merge payment
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
 recharge1.txt | 0
 recharge2.txt | 0
 recharge3.txt | 0
 recharge4.txt | 0
 recharge5.txt | 0
 5 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

 create mode 100644 recharge2.txt
 create mode 100644 recharge3.txt
 create mode 100644 recharge4.txt
 create mode 100644 recharge5.txt

git rebase dth
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/payment.

==> MERGE CONFLICT
one file, two branches, two developers

Dev1	- Branch1	- code.txt		- Java Code
Dev2	- Branch2	- code.txt		- Python Code
When we merge conflict occurs because both developers changed the same file

Note: All the conflicts have to be resolved MANUALLY

First merge 
	Branch1 ----> Master
	NO CONFLICTS
	The existing data which was there in master branch file has been overwritten

Second merge
	Branch2 ----> Master
	CONFLICTS WILL COME

==> CHERRY PICK
